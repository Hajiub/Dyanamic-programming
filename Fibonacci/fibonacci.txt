Wrie a function fib(n) that takes in a number as an argument. The function should return
the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.
The 1st and 2nd number of the sequence is 1.
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

    n:      0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,  8, ...
    fib(n)  0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 ...
